# TV too high!

The living room initially had a large stone faux fireplace wall with the TV mounted very high for such a shallow room.

The stone was removed and the wall was demoed. A new wall was built with a new frame for an electric fireplace to replace the gas one that was there previously. A small counter/mantle was added in order to give depth. The TV was then mounted on the newly built shiplap covered wall.
